        <h1>Korean Fried Chicken</h1>
        <img src="./images/korean-chicken.jpeg">

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p class="font-twenty-five">Korean-style fried chicken is similar to American fried chicken in that it has a crispy coating and juicy meat. Two things set it apart:

            <ol class="font-twenty-five">
                <li class="font-twenty-five">The sauce—a sweet or spicy sticky concoction that thinly coats the chicken</li>
                <li>The double-frying process that yields an incredibly crispy, crunchy exterior.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <p class="font-twenty-five">Traditional cuisine aside, Korean fried chicken got its start in the U.S post-1950. Black American troops in Osan, Seoul, and Pyeongtaek, who had to celebrate Thanksgiving with chicken instead of turkey, fried and shared with fellow Korean troops. A Korean tank driver called it “a taste of heaven,” a sentiment most Koreans would come to agree with.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <h3 class="font-twenty-five">Marinade:</h3>

        <ul class="font-twenty-five">
            <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, quartered</li>
            <li>1/2 yellow onion, grated</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon fine salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>

            <h3>Other:</h3>

            <ul class="font-twenty-five">
                <li>4 cups oil for frying, or as needed</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Batter</h3>

            <ul class="font-twenty-five">
                <li>3/4 cup cornstarch</li>
                <li>1/2 cup self-rising flour</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 cup very cold water, or as needed</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>

            <ol class="font-twenty-five">
                <li>Make marinade: Stir together chicken, onion, garlic, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl until chicken is coated. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 4 hours to overnight.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a deep fryer or large saucepan to 340 degrees F (171 degrees C).</li>
                <li>While oil is heating, make batter: Whisk together cornstarch, flour, sugar, pepper, and salt in a large bowl. Gradually whisk in cold water until mixture resembles smooth pancake batter. Use tongs to remove chicken from marinade to batter; stir to coat chicken completely. Discard marinade.</li>
                <li>Working in batches, fry chicken in hot oil for 4 minutes. Transfer chicken to a cooling rack.</li>
                <li>Increase oil temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Working in batches, fry chicken again in hot oil until golden brown and crispy, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to drain.</li>
            </ol>
