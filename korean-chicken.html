        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Korean-style fried chicken is similar to American fried chicken in that it has a crispy coating and juicy meat. Two things set it apart:

            <ol>
                <li>The sauce—a sweet or spicy sticky concoction that thinly coats the chicken</li>
                <li>The double-frying process that yields an incredibly crispy, crunchy exterior.</li>
            </ol>

            Traditional cuisine aside, Korean fried chicken got its start in the U.S post-1950. Black American troops in Osan, Seoul, and Pyeongtaek, who had to celebrate Thanksgiving with chicken instead of turkey, fried and shared with fellow Korean troops. A Korean tank driver called it “a taste of heaven,” a sentiment most Koreans would come to agree with.
